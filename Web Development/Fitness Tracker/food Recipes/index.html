                <p class="info">
                    Sahi Paneer is a rich and creamy Indian dish made with paneer (cottage cheese) in a flavorful tomato and cashew-based gravy. To prepare Sahi Paneer, start by heating oil in a pan and saut√©ing chopped onions until golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and cook until fragrant, then stir in tomato puree until the oil separates. Grind soaked cashew nuts into a paste and add it to the tomato mixture, cooking until well incorporated. Season with red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and salt, then add fresh cream and mix thoroughly. Gently add paneer cubes to the gravy and cook for a few minutes until heated through. Finish with a sprinkle of garam masala and garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with naan or rice for a delicious meal. Sahi Paneer offers a delightful combination of creamy texture and aromatic spices, making it a popular choice in Indian cuisine
